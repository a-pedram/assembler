# assembler
This code directly create ".com" (a Dos and old windows executable file format) from an assembly file(8086 instruction set).
I wrote this code in 1998 when I was only 16. Those days, I didn't access to the internet or even good offline software source. I had just begun to learn assembly, but had not couldn't find assembler, so I decided to write one by myself!
I decoded the 8086 instruction set by "DOS's debug"! and wrote this code! It was so exciting experience that I don't know if I can experience such an excitement again or not!
